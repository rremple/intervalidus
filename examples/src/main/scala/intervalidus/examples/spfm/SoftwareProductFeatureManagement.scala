/**
  * Based on the capabilities outlined in the sources and our ongoing discussion about Intervalidus's strengths, an
  * application that would be particularly interesting and demonstrate a comprehensive use of the library would be a
  * "Software Product Feature Lifecycle and Rollout Management System."
  *
  * This application would be a robust demonstration of Intervalidus's ability to model complex, evolving, and
  * multidimensional data where "validity as a kind of collection" is paramount. It would highlight the utility of
  * DataMulti, DataVersioned, and the full range of query methods, especially `values` and `intervals(value)`, which
  * enable reverse lookups that are often crucial in such systems.
  *
  * Think of it like a multi-layered, living map of a software product's evolution. Just as a map shows you where a
  * specific landmark (feature) exists (its intervals of validity) and what landmarks are present in a given area
  * (feature sets for a release), this system would enable navigating the complex landscape of product features across
  * versions, environments, and time, both forward and backward.
  *
  * Here's why this application would be an excellent fit and how it would leverage Intervalidus's core features...
