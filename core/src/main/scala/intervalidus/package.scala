/**
  * Intervalidus is a Scala library with zero dependencies for representing data as valid only in discrete or continuous
  * intervals, one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional. It answers the question "In what intervals are your data
  * valid?"
  *
  * This top-level package includes Intervalidus's main traits, classes, and other members:
  *   - Type classes for common discrete and continuous domain values.
  *   - Foundational case classes, type classes, and enums for one-, two-, three-, and four-dimensional domains,
  *     intervals, diff actions, and valid data.
  *   - Both general and dimension-specific base traits for dimensional data, including versioned and multivalued data.
