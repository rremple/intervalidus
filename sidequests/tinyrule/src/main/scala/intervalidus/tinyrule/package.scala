package intervalidus

/**
  * A toy rules engine which is not strictly related to Intervalidus, but it is used in an example rules-based
  * application that shows how Intervalidus structures can be used to capture the outcomes of patients in a clinical
  * trial. The toy rules engine is used to interpret daily measurements, and Intervalidus to capture progress concisely.
  * It uses some interesting generic and metaprogramming features of Scala 3 to represent and process facts.
